    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chana masala is a North Indian curried dish made with white chickpeas, onions, tomatoes, spices and herbs. &lsquo;Chana &rsquo;is a Hindi word for &lsquo;Chickpeas &rsquo;and &lsquo;Masala &rsquo;here refers to a &lsquo;spiced gravy &rsquo;. So Chana Masala is nothing but chickpeas simmered in a spicy onion tomato masala.</p>
    <p>Though the dish originated in the Punjab region of India, it is made in numerous ways across the Indian sub-continent. So Chana masala is a common term that refers to a chickpea curry.</p>
    <p>You will find anywhere from extremely spicy to mild toned down versions. The recipe shared here will yield you something in between the both but you can easily up or cut down the spices further to suit your taste.</p>

        <li>Grind onion, tomato, ginger, garlic, and chile pepper together in a food processor into a paste. </li>
        <li> Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Fry bay leaves in hot oil until fragrant, about 30 seconds.

Season the mixture with chili powder, coriander, gram masala, turmeric, and salt; cook and stir until very hot, 2 to 3 minutes. </li>
        <li> Stir enough water into the mixture to get a thick gravy; bring to a boil and stir chickpeas into the gravy. Reduce heat to medium and cook until the chickpeas are heated through, 5 to 7 minutes. Garnish with cilantro. </li>
